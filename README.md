Html code to emulate a scratch-off Team Based Learning GRAT test and e-mail results to the teacher.
During a Team-Based Learning lesson, a fundamental step is the application of a Group Readiness Assessment Test (GRAT).
This was originally administered as a paper scratch-off test, and students got points according to the number of attempts necessary to solve each question, at the same time providing immediate feedback on all answers.
This is a simple html file that is capable of digitally emulating a scratch-off test and e-mailing students' answers to the teacher. Alternatively, test results for each team  may be sent to the teacher by a Telegram bot.
